I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Materials Characterization and Processing Facility at Johns Hopkins University. My research involves electrochemistry, particularly electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS), as a tool to study ion transport, interfacial processes, and charge storage. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D in Chemical Engineering and Data Science at the University of Washington, where I researched ways to combine high-throughput experiments with computer simulations and machine learning to better understand and design new nanomaterials.
