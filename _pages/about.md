I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Materials Characterization and Processing Facility at Johns Hopkins University. My research involves electrochemistry, particularly electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS), as a tool to study ion transport, interfacial processes, and charge storage. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D in Chemical Engineering and Data Science at the University of Washington, where I researched ways to combine high-throughput experiments with computer simulations and machine learning to better understand and design new nanomaterials.

I am an international student originally from Brazil. Check out my <a href="https://huatc.github.io/year-archive/">Blog Posts</a> where I write about things I wished I knew at each stage of my academic journey in the United States. 

Outside of research, I enjoy long distance running. I am actively training for several half-marathons and hope to run a full marathon sometime in the future.
