I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Materials Characterization and Processing Facility at John's Hopkins University. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D in chemical engineering at the University of Washington. My research combines high-throughput experiments (like X-ray and neutron scattering) with computer simulations and machine learning to better understand and design new nanomaterials.
