Introduction
======
- Basic Research vs Applied Reseach 
- Objective of a PhD (perform independent reserach)
  - publishing papers, writing dissertation

- How to choose advisor
- Talk to group students, alumni, what alumni are doing 
- Assistant Professor 

    - Pros: Their success depends on your success, Less of an Age Gap, You can start the lab with them like buying equiptment, If they are a new professor they will get a startup package from the university which guarantees funding for a while, 

    - Cons: They might not know what they are doing and might quit academia, May push your to publish papers so they can get tenure, May not get tenure which would then make you find another lab, Are at a stage in life where they are starting a family so they may be extremely busy, They might not have a lot of connections as someone who has been a professor for a longer time, Fewer alumni means you do not really know what their students do after graduating 

- Tenured Professor 
    - Pros: They have more experience writing grants, Have more connections, more experience mentoring students, in some cases more funding, more lab alumni so you have an idea of what to expect when you graduate, 

    - Cons: Large age gap, May soon be retiring and therefore wont care about the student, already have tenure so they do not have to worry about research,
