**Advice for Graduate Students**
====
Deciding to pursue a PhD is a major commitment. Unlike undergraduate or master’s degrees, the goal of a PhD is not just learning existing knowledge but creating new knowledge. It requires years of independent research, publishing papers, and ultimately writing a dissertation that contributes to your field. Below, I share some guidance on what a PhD involves, how to choose the right advisor, and what career paths are available afterward.

**Basic vs Applied Research**

Basic research is driven by curiosity and a desire to expand scientific understanding without immediate practical applications. This research is usually funded by the government since there is no immediate practical application. The results of this research are often publically shared for others to build upon. Many technologies that exist today are only possible because of basic research (e.g., DNA tests, self-driving cars, Lithium-Ion Batteries). This [article](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/%E2%80%9Cwhy-are-we-funding-this%E2%80%9D) does a great job explaining the importance of it.

On the other had, applied research is focused on solving practical problems and often leads to new technologies, products, or processes. For example, developing a new drug delivery system or improving renewable energy efficiency. Funding for this kind of research often comes from the industry and the results may be proprietary. 

**Choosing an Advisor**
====
Your advisor (PI, or principal investigator) will have a huge impact on your PhD experience. Most gradutate school programs allow you to choose your advisor so choosing carefully can make the difference between a successful, enjoyable program and a difficult one. These are some things to consider or do when choosing your advisor. 

- Talk to current graduate students in the lab to get an honest view of day-to-day life.
- Reach out to lab alumni and see where they ended up after graduation. This gives you a sense of career outcomes.
- Pay attention to the professor’s mentoring style, availability, and expectations.
- Prioritize a good advisor rather than a good project. Your project can change quickly, but it is often harder to change advisors. 

**Assistant Professors**

Pros
- Their success depends on your success, so they are often highly motivated to help you publish and graduate.
- Smaller age gap may make them more relatable.
- You may get to help build the lab from the ground up, including setting up equipment and shaping the research culture.
- New faculty typically receive a startup funding package that guarantees support for several years.

Cons
- Less experience in managing a lab and mentoring students.
- Higher risk of leaving academia if they do not get tenure.
- May push students aggressively to publish in order to secure tenure.
- Starting a family or balancing heavy demands may make them less available.
- Fewer alumni means less clarity on what career outcomes look like.

**Tenured Professors**

Pros
- More experience in writing grants, securing funding, and in performing reserach.
- Larger professional network and established collaborations.
- Experienced in mentoring students and guiding them through challenges.
- More lab alumni so you can see clear career trajectories after graduation.

Cons
- Larger age gap may create a difference in communication styles.
- Some may be nearing retirement and less invested in new students.
- Already have tenure, so they may feel less pressure to push ambitious research goals.


**What Makes a Successful PhD**
====
A successful PhD is not defined just by finishing. It means leaving the program with skills, experiences, and confidence that prepare you for the next stage of your career. This includes:

- Publishing papers in peer-reviewed journals.
- Building technical and transferable skills (writing, communication, leadership).
- Developing independence in designing and leading projects.
- Networking within your field through conferences and collaborations.


**Career Paths After a PhD**
====

**Industry**
Industry jobs often emphasize applying knowledge to real-world problems. Having a PhD can set you apart from bachelor’s or master’s graduates by:
- Giving you specialized expertise in a niche area.
- Preparing you for leadership roles in research and development.
- Showing employers you can tackle complex, long-term projects.

PhD graduates in industry often work in R&D, data science, consulting, or product development. The advantage is higher pay compared to academia, clearer work-life balance in many companies, and a faster pace of projects.

**National Labs**
- National laboratories are government-funded research centers that sit between academia and industry.
- Like academia, they focus on publishing and advancing knowledge.
- Like industry, they often work on large applied projects with real-world impact.
- National labs can provide stability, cutting-edge resources, and opportunities to work on large-scale collaborations.
- They are a good option if you enjoy research but prefer a team-oriented environment with broader societal impact.

**Academia**
Academia is the traditional career path after a PhD, leading to a position as a professor. Professors split their time between research, teaching, and service to their university. The path typically requires postdoctoral research after your PhD before applying for faculty jobs.

Academia offers the freedom to choose your research topics and the opportunity to mentor students. However, it comes with challenges: intense competition for funding, long hours, and the pressure to publish. Pursuing academia should be driven by passion for research and teaching rather than prestige alone.

**Closing Thoughts**
====
A PhD is about learning how to ask questions that nobody has answered before and developing the skills to find those answers. Choosing the right advisor and understanding the career paths available will help you make the most of the experience. Whether you end up in industry, a national lab, or academia, the PhD can open doors, but only if it matches your passions and long-term goals.
