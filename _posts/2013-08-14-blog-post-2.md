**Advice for Graduate Students: Finishing a PhD**
====
Deciding to pursue a PhD is a major commitment. Unlike undergraduate or master’s degrees, the goal of a PhD is not just learning existing knowledge but creating new knowledge. It requires years of independent research, publishing papers, and ultimately writing a dissertation that contributes to your field. Below, I share some guidance on what a PhD involves, how to choose the right advisor, and what career paths are available afterward. This advice is from my personal experiences so they may be more relavent for engineering PhDs. 


**What is Research**

Research in a PhD is the process of creating new knowledge by asking original questions and working to find answers that no one has discovered before. Unlike coursework, which focuses on learning established ideas, PhD research involves designing experiments, developing methods, analyzing data, and interpreting results in order to push the boundaries of a field. It requires persistence, creativity, and independence, since the outcome is often uncertain and may take years to achieve. The ultimate goal is to make a contribution that is significant enough to be shared with the scientific community through publications and, eventually, summarized in a dissertation. In addition, there are two categories of research: Basic and Applied. 

Basic research is driven by curiosity and a desire to expand scientific understanding without immediate practical applications. This research is usually funded by the government since there is no immediate practical application. The results of this research are often publically shared for others to build upon. Many technologies that exist today are only possible because of basic research (e.g., DNA tests, self-driving cars, Lithium-Ion Batteries). This [article](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/%E2%80%9Cwhy-are-we-funding-this%E2%80%9D) does a great job explaining the importance of it.

On the other had, applied research is focused on solving practical problems and often leads to new technologies, products, or processes. For example, developing a new drug delivery system or improving renewable energy efficiency. Funding for this kind of research often comes from the industry. When a company funds research, it typically owns the results. Whereas academic success is normally tied to prompt publication of findings, a company's financial success often depends on keeping certain information confidential during research and development. Researchers collaborating with industry may be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement, promising not to publish results or methods without the sponsor's authorization and agreeing to a period of time in which the sponsor can assess the value of new findings.

**Choosing an Advisor**
====
Your advisor (PI, or principal investigator) will have a huge impact on your PhD experience. Most gradutate school programs allow you to choose your advisor in the beginning of your first year so choosing carefully can make the difference between a successful, enjoyable program and a difficult one. These are some things to consider or do when choosing your advisor. 

- Talk to current graduate or undergraduate students in the lab to get an honest view of day-to-day life.
- Reach out to lab alumni and see where they ended up after graduation. This gives you a sense of career outcomes.
- Pay attention to the professor’s mentoring style, availability, and expectations.
- Read the advisor's previous papers to get an idea of what skills you will learn if you join the lab.
- Check out the advisor's lab website.
- Check out the advisor's social media to see what kinds of posts they make.   
- Prioritize a good advisor rather than a good project. Your project can change quickly depending on funding, but it is often harder to change advisors. 

**Assistant Professors**

Pros
- Their success (getting tenured) depends on your success, so they are often highly motivated to help you publish and graduate.
- Smaller age gap may make them more relatable.
- You may get to help build the lab from the ground up, including setting up equipment and shaping the research culture.
- New faculty typically receive a startup funding package that guarantees support for several years.

Cons
- Less experience in managing a lab and mentoring students.
- Higher risk of leaving academia if they do not get tenure.
- May push students aggressively to publish in order to secure tenure.
- Starting a family or balancing heavy demands may make them less available.
- Fewer alumni means less clarity on what career outcomes look like.

**Tenured Professors**

Pros
- More experience in writing grants, securing funding, and in performing reserach.
- Larger professional network and established collaborations.
- Experienced in mentoring students and guiding them through challenges.
- More lab alumni so you can see clear career trajectories after graduation.

Cons
- Larger age gap may create a difference in communication styles.
- Some may be nearing retirement and less invested in new students.
- Already have tenure, so they may feel less pressure to push ambitious research goals.


**How to have a Successful PhD**
====
(This section is very biased towards my personal experiences, so this may not apply to everyone) 

There are many ways to measure success in a PhD, so I will cover three common metrics: how to publish as much as possible, how to complete your dissertation, how to land your next position. 

**Publishing as much as Possible**

Publishing papers is a key skill developed during a PhD, and it is often viewed as a measure of success in graduate training. It plays an essential role in building your academic reputation, showcasing your ability to conduct and communicate research, strengthening your chances of securing academic positions, and adding new knowledge to the scientific community. This is especially important if you are pursuing a career in academia and national labs, or if you are planning on applying for employment based green cards. Some metrics that are commonly used to define your publishing ability are number of papers, number of first-author papers, number of citations, and papers published in impactful journals (journals with high impact factor). Here's some advice that worked for me.

- When you join a lab, take time to read the group’s recently published papers and look into the contributions of each author and co-author. This will help you identify which skills are considered valuable and can increase your chances of being included on future publications. It is also useful to understand the expectations for earning a first-author paper compared to being listed as a co-author, so you know what level of involvement and initiative is required for each.
- In your first year, focus on learning a valuable high-demand skill that requires some effort to master. For me, this was small-angle X-ray scattering which can be used to characterize all sorts or nanomaterials, but takes some effort analyze its data. Because I developed expertise in this area, many people at my university reached out to me for help with measurements, and I was able to earn co-authorship on their papers. Once you have a specialized skill, you can also leverage it at your university or at conferences by offering your expertise as a way to collaborate on projects and publications.
- PhD students often publish the most papers in their fourth or fifth year. When you first join a lab, it is common to be paired with senior students for training. Make an effort to build good relationships with them and look for ways to contribute to their research. By helping out, you may have the opportunity to be included as a co-author on their papers. The same approach applies to postdocs, who are typically under strong pressure to publish and often welcome additional support. 
- Writing review papers can be a powerful way to boost your visibility as a researcher, since they are often highly cited and can significantly raise your citation count. The main challenge is in identifying a popular or emerging topic that has not already been extensively covered. Review articles frequently include many co-authors ([example](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/dd/d3dd00113j)), with each contributing a smaller portion, but all sharing in the resulting citations. Increasingly, researchers are also using AI tools to help organize literature and draft these types of papers, making the process more efficient. This is one of the best ways to obtain citations for Employment Based green cards (EB1A, EB2-NIW). 

**Completing a Dissertation**

In all PhD programs, you must write a dissertation. A dissertation is the final written document (usually 100 or more pages) that summarizes the original research you carried out during your doctoral studies. It demonstrates that you can design and complete an independent research project, analyze the results, and place your work in the context of existing scientific knowledge. The dissertation usually includes an introduction, background literature review, research methods, results, and a discussion of their significance. The dissertation must be defended in front of a committee, where you present your findings and answer questions to demonstrate your expertise.

This may seem like a lot of work, but it does not have to be if you prepare early. Most of the chapters of the dissertation are copies of your publications, so if you already have a lot of publications you can just copy and paste them with a few modifications. The amount of work that you need to do for the rest of the dissertation (i.e., introduction, background, conclusion) really depends on how much your advisor cares about it. Some advisors want detailed dissertations so their future students can easily learn all the skills that you obtained in your PhD. Others only care about publications. Either way, you will have to write a dissertation and here's some advice that worked for me:

- Everything you write/make in your PhD can go in your dissertation. Save all your manuscripts, presentations, abstracts, funding applications, etc starting from your first year of your PhD and add them to the dissertation when you start writing it. 
- If your advisor expects a good dissertation, you have to start early. Focus on the introduction and background because those sections take the most time.
- Use a good citation manager and a good editor that can handle large documents. If you start using this early in grad school it will save a lot of problems in the future. I used overleaf as an editor with zotero as a citation manager and it worked perfectly for me. Many universities have an overleaf subscription so make use of it. 

**Landing your Next Position**




**Career Paths After a PhD**
====

**Industry**

Industry jobs often emphasize applying knowledge to real-world problems. Having a PhD can set you apart from bachelor’s or master’s graduates by:
- Giving you specialized expertise in a niche area.
- Preparing you for leadership roles in research and development.
- Showing employers you can tackle complex, long-term projects.

PhD graduates in industry often work in R&D, data science, consulting, or product development. The advantage is higher pay compared to academia, clearer work-life balance in many companies, and a faster pace of projects.

**National Labs**

- National laboratories are government-funded research centers that sit between academia and industry. In the USA, there are several national labs. Some hire international students (ORNL, LBNL, Argonne, BNL, PNNL), while others only hire US Citizens. 
- Like academia, they focus on publishing and advancing knowledge.
- Like industry, they often work on large applied projects with real-world impact.
- National labs can provide stability, cutting-edge resources, and opportunities to work on large-scale collaborations.
- They are a good option if you enjoy research but prefer a team-oriented environment with broader societal impact.

**Academia**

Academia is the traditional career path after a PhD, leading to a position as a professor. Professors split their time between research, teaching, and service to their university. The path typically requires postdoctoral research after your PhD before applying for faculty jobs.

Academia offers the freedom to choose your research topics and the opportunity to mentor students. However, it comes with challenges: intense competition for funding, long hours, and the pressure to publish. Pursuing academia should be driven by passion for research and teaching rather than prestige alone.

**Closing Thoughts**
====
A PhD is about learning how to ask questions that nobody has answered before and developing the skills to find those answers. Choosing the right advisor and understanding the career paths available will help you make the most of the experience. Whether you end up in industry, a national lab, or academia, the PhD can open doors, but only if it matches your passions and long-term goals.
